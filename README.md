# Impainting
## How to use it:
 1. Preparations: Put the original image (the one you want to operate) as well as 
the masked image (the one with the impainting area masked by a specific color) under the same path as the matlab code.
 2. Open the plotall.m file with MATLAB modify the parameters in the function as needed
For example: 
'''matlab
[i1,i2,i3,c,d,mov]=inpaint('1.png','2.png',[255 0 0]);
'''
   * 1.png: The original image.
   * 2.png: The masked image.
   * [255,0,0]: The color used to mask the impainting area.
 3. Examples included.
 4. Remember to leave a **Star** if you'll be so kind.
